This is basically all the trial datasets.

train (alternatively, train1): A bunch of 100 randomly scattered diamonds on the map
train2 : Single diamonds on the map
train3 : Single dots(single pixel-sized and binary), convolved with a Gaussian Point-Spread Function (PSF) on the map
train4 : 10 randomly scattered dots(single pixel-sized and binary), convolved with a Gaussian PSF
